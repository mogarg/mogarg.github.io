      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Organically DevOps: Building Quality and Security into the Software Supply Chain at Liberty Mutual</title>
      <link>https://mogarg.github.io/publications/alldaydevops/</link>

      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:
 Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://mogarg.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>While adding Structured Data to a client&amp;rsquo;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid. Simple contribution to cleanup the user documentation providing syntactically valid JSON documents.</description>

      <description>This article presents a summary of the paper by Lalith Suresh, Dahlia Malkhi, Parikshit Gopalan, Ivan Porto Carreiro, and Zeeshan Lokhandwala, which appeared in USENIX Annual Technical Conference 2018. I also presented this paper in the Distributed Systems Reading Group, a weekly public paper reading group hosted by Prof Murat Debirmas.
This paper primarily about membership in distributed systems in the presence of gray failures. While crash faults are relatively easy to detect and fix, gray failures often go undetected or take a long time to localize and fix.</description>

      <title>Elpis</title>

      <description>Thesis My thesis can be found here.
Motivation While internet services are designed and deployed with an assumption of perimeter less security at the application layer, most production distributed systems today are designed assuming a classical Crash Fault Tolerant (CFT) model. In realistic deployment scenarios, keeping track of all bridged networks such as smartphones, network printers, etc. is almost impossible. Hence, designing distributed systems without considering the possibility of an active adversary makes the system vulnerable from its core.</description>

      <description>Apollo is a ticketing management system prototype. Musical events have several stakeholders like the music label, the venue management and the artist themself. This smart-contract adds transparency to the process. Major features include:
 Buying tickets for a show, requiring the correct amount tickets cost Transferring tickets to other wallets Verifying ownership of tickets through contract methods.  For more information, please check out https://github.com/mogarg/Apollo)</description>

      <description>I helped found the Mobile Development Team at Indus Valley Partners by working on several applications including IVP Nebula. IVP Nebula, enables alternative asset managers to access Key Performance Indicators, Portfolio Insights, Enterprise Data.
Key Features I was involved from the ideation stage and contributed to key features:
 Power Optimization: Developed query processing and caching strategies for optimizing power consumption. Security: Developed a library to provide easy access to File Encryption, Network Communication based on Crytographic Hashing/Encryption algorithms provided by the Common Crypto Framework.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
